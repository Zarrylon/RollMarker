# RollMarker

## Task
Development of a simple game scene in Unreal Engine.

## Gameplay
The player controls a marker character with the objective of painting all targets on the level in their color. Painting a target occurs when the player collides with it. Marked targets, upon colliding with unmarked targets, will also paint them in the player's color.

The scene also includes "cleaners" - targets that can revert marked targets back to their initial state. Targets move randomly across the scene, adding complexity to the gameplay.

The game ends when all targets, including the cleaners, are painted in the player's color.
